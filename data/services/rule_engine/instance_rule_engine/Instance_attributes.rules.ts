 * This rule check if the entered attribute value match the rexgex of the meta attribute type

 * `attributeType[0]`, so the check ran only when there was nothing to check with
 * and was skipped whenever the attribute had a type - which is to say it never
 * enforced anything. Enforcing it is a deliberate behaviour change, decided by
 * the operator: a value that does not match its type's regex is now refused with
 * 403 where it used to be stored.
 *
 * Two cases accept without testing, because there is no constraint to apply
 * rather than because the value satisfies one: an attribute whose type states no
 * regex, and an instance carrying no value at all. The latter covers the sentinel
 * strings the modeling clients store for an unset attribute ("not defined",
 * "undefined", "") as well as a real null/undefined - see `numerise` in
 * mmar-modeling-client-react/src/resources/services/format.ts.
